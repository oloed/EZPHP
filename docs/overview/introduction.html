			EZPHP is an easy-to-use <span class="hint" title="Model View Controller">MVC-based</span> framework allowing you to develop applications much faster than doing it
			from scratch by providing you with ready-made libraries and utility classes. It comes with a
			mechanism to easily develop your applications in <span class="hint" title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</span> way even if you are
			not much familiar with it. EZPHP aims to be light-weight, fast and easy to use thereby
			targeted to those who want to get the framework complexities out of the their way and start
			writing the application fast from day one.
			<br /><br />
			If you are looking to quickly develop a website, EZPHP provides you with easier <span class="hint" title="Model View Controller">MVC</span> and <span class="hint" title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</span>
			approach with handy library and helper classes to get the job done fast. Or if you don't want
			to learn or use some hard to use/learn frameworks available, EZPHP then most probably becomes
			your definite choice.

		MVC is a design pattern. A design pattern is a code structure that allows for common coding frameworks to be
		replicated quickly. You might think of a design pattern as a skeleton or framework on which your application
		will be built. The most obvious benefit of a MVC framework is that it helps you separate the business logic
		(database) and the presentation logic (design). This simply means that a developer and a designer can work
		independently on a site developed using MVC pattern; there work won't clash because a developer will be
		working on controller and model part while a designer will be working on view part. MVC frameworks let
		programmers organize their code into three distinct functional areas:

		<br />
		<br />
		<div align="center">
			<img align="absmiddle" src="./../images/mvc.png" />
		</div>
		<br /><br />

		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Models</strong> contain any and all code that relates to your database and other
				data structures. If you had a table called pages, you'd have a model for it
				and functions within that for selecting, creating, updating, and deleting
				records from that table, among other things.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>Views</strong> contain all your display and UI elements, your JavaScript code,
				Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HTML, and even PHP.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<strong>Controllers</strong> hold it all together. Each function in a controller represents a
				destination or route. If you had a destination called /about, your controller
				would have a function called about(). Basically, a controller decides which model
				and which view to run. It is a contract between views and models.
			</li>
		  </ol>

		<div class="subbox">Why Use MVC?</div>
		<div class="spacer">.</div>

		If you haven't worked with an MVC framework before, above three bullet points offer
		hardly any clue as to the power behind this organizational scheme. Once you start
		thinking in terms of MVC, your perspective about and attitude toward PHP
		development changes radically.	
		<br />
		<br />
		For example, instead of tucking database query code in every available nook and
		cranny of your project, you organize all of it into models. And to select a page from
		your database table, you use a function from the pages model.	
		<br /><br />
		Similarly, if you need to update the look and feel of a certain page, you work with the
		views. You don't mess around with the controller. Likewise, the controller is where
		you add destinations and other controlling code for your application; you don't put
		any of that stuff in your model.
		<br /><br />
		Within a day or so of working with any MVC framework, you'll realize that you have a
		system that is easy to remember and scale up as needed. If the customer needs a
		change next week, no problem, you can handle it. The same goes if the request
		comes in next year.
		
		<br /><br />
		In a nutshell, here are the <em>most obvious</em> advantages of this system:
		<br /><br />
		
		<ul>
			<li>Objects-Oriented-Programming (OOP) which is always ideal with a host of its advantages.</li>
			<li>Separation of business logic and presentation logic; both developer and designer can work safely/independently, no coding clash.</li>
			<li>A project developed with this system is easy to remember and extend even after a year. No problem even for new/coming developers.</li>
		</ul>
